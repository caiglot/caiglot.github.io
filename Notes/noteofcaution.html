<h1><br><br><br>Note of Caution<br><br></h1>

<h2>

<br><br>As the introduction to the website makes clear, I present the materials here in conversation and tension with dominant practices of preemption. Preemption relies on a mode of imagining possible futures that is tied to complex math through which it seeks to represent non-linear processes and low-probability events. Such a relation to the future may be far from the 'modern' presuppositions of regularity and repetition that characterized statistical prediction. Nevertheless, preemption continues to share many of the Western scientific and secular paradigms that marked stochastic prediction: it assumes that the past comes before the future, that space and natural objects behave according to tendencies (regular or irregular), that these objects are not endowed with intentionality, that the future remains unknown to experience but can be modeled and approximated in terms of the possible and, most definitely, that the future is not a subject or being that we can communicate with. <br>My relation to &lsquo;what is coming&rsquo; is strongly marked by these paradigms. Thus the &lsquo;futures&rsquo; visualized in this platform are not, in any sense, futures that I can claim to know, nor have they made themselves evident to me with any sense of certainty. I make this note because I recognize that others may have different relations to what I call the future: they may have seen it, and thus need not imagine it. Some may have lived it already and now remember it. Perhaps one has seen the sun forget us already, other perceives my fears as a parent who laughs at the little one&rsquo;s fear of ghosts in the dark. The timelines here, insofar as they go past &lsquo;2019,&rsquo; are then, for me, more performative than true. I wrote them as fictions of sorts, knowing that their lack of referential specificity or value has a potential to reaffirm the boundaries between fact and fear, living and nonliving, risk and hallucination that the notion of Parametric Apprehension seeks to dispel. Acknowledging that I relate to these stories as &lsquo;fictions,&rsquo; however, allows me to recognize that others may be able to attend to the sociality of the future, of the sun, and of the stratosphere in ways that this platform can only timidly begin to indicate. </h2>
