<h1>&ldquo;Why and How?&rdquo; <br><br><br><br><br></h1>

<h2>
This website is a story, a timeline extending into many futures, and a vertical map. Most importantly, it is a first attempt to practice &lsquo;Parametric Apprehension,&rsquo; by which I designate a futures modelling technique that tries to transform the calculation of risk, in this case risk inherent in solar geoengineering experimentation, by forming a constellation of precedents and intuitions that attend to the entanglement of technoscientific practices, colonialism, and capitalist expansion. The timeline, then, is not historical but anticipatory: past events are not selected in an attempt to produce a complete historical account, but to inform a forecasting practice. The concept of Parametric Apprehension suggests that we fear intentionally, that we attend to the signs of unfoldings in the past and in the present, and that we use these signs as scientists use their records: as legitimate parameters to calculate what is to come, and what we fear this &lsquo;coming-ness&rsquo; may dangerously bring with itself. Thus visualizing some futures, as this page aims to do, responds not to the requirement to envision what is most likely, but instead what is most feared. This requirement is indeed common practice in risk assessments, and has been designated in terms of a legal compulsion to consider the &lsquo;maximum hypothetical accident&rsquo; entailed by a particular course of action. Engaging in Parametric Apprehension can then mean to consciously craft visions of the maximum hypothetical accident in ways that acknowledge that any preemptive, risk-driven practice is marked and enabled by infrastructures and affects of fearful forecasting. If risk assessment involves such an imaginative and sentimental effort, there is an opening for a politics of partisan or counter-logistical fearing. Some may call it the power of negative thinking. And yet, as Chun argues, the point of forecasts is that they are unverifiable: &ldquo;to wait for the models&rsquo; calculations to be verified &mdash; for their accuracy to be proven &mdash; is to give up on the future by rewriting political problems as ones that science can (dis-)solve&rdquo; (4). And so the point of my pessimism around Harvard&rsquo;s developments in solar geoengineering &mdash; the futures that this website foresees &mdash; is not to be proven correct. To apprehend some futures by fearing them (parametric apprehension) does not mean to predict them with accuracy but to play in the game of preemption at a time when apprehensive planetary terraforming is a possibility sought by the current assemblage of racial capitalism. </h2>
