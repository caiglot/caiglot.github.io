    <div class="citation"> <h2>The difference between a concept and a formative force of history becomes a question of perspective—which is why, try as it might, historiography can never disentangle itself from philosophy, especially when it is a question of such fundamentally quizzical issues as preemption and ontopower. Alone, historiography cannot approach them—much less the crucial question for the future of what a counter-ontopower might be. (Brian Massumi, ix)</h2> </div>

The bright sun was extinguish'd, and the stars <br />
Did wander darkling in the eternal space, <br />
Rayless, and pathless, and the icy earth <br />
Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air; <br />
Morn came and went&mdash;and came, and brought no day, <br />
And men forgot their passions in the dread <br />
Of this their desolation; and all hearts <br />
Were chill'd into a selfish prayer for light: <br />
And they did live by watchfires&mdash;and the thrones, <br />
The palaces of crowned kings&mdash;the huts, <br />
The habitations of all things which dwell, <br />
Were burnt for beacons; cities were consum'd, <br />
And men were gather'd round their blazing homes <br />
To look once more into each other's face; <br />
Happy were those who dwelt within the eye <br />
Of the volcanos, and their mountain-torch: <br />
A fearful hope was all the world contain'd; <br />
Forests were set on fire&mdash;but hour by hour <br />
They fell and faded&mdash;and the crackling trunks <br />
Extinguish'd with a crash&mdash;and all was black. <br />
The brows of men by the despairing light <br />
Wore an unearthly aspect, as by fits <br />
The flashes fell upon them; some lay down <br />
And hid their eyes and wept; and some did rest <br />
Their chins upon their clenched hands, and smil'd; <br />
And others hurried to and fro, and fed <br />
Their funeral piles with fuel, and look'd up <br />
With mad disquietude on the dull sky, <br />
The pall of a past world; and then again <br />
With curses cast them down upon the dust, <br />
And gnash'd their teeth and howl'd: the wild birds shriek'd <br />
And, terrified, did flutter on the ground, <br />
And flap their useless wings; the wildest brutes <br />
Came tame and tremulous; and vipers crawl'd <br />
And twin'd themselves among the multitude, <br />
Hissing, but stingless&mdash;they were slain for food. <br />
And War, which for a moment was no more, <br />
Did glut himself again: a meal was bought <br />
With blood, and each sate sullenly apart <br />
Gorging himself in gloom: no love was left; <br />
All earth was but one thought&mdash;and that was death <br />
Immediate and inglorious; and the pang <br />
Of famine fed upon all entrails&mdash;men <br />
Died, and their bones were tombless as their flesh; <br />
The meagre by the meagre were devour'd, <br />
Even dogs assail'd their masters, all save one, <br />
And he was faithful to a corse, and kept <br />
The birds and beasts and famish'd men at bay, <br />
Till hunger clung them, or the dropping dead <br />
Lur'd their lank jaws; himself sought out no food, <br />
But with a piteous and perpetual moan, <br />
And a quick desolate cry, licking the hand <br />
Which answer'd not with a caress&mdash;he died. <br />
The crowd was famish'd by degrees; but two <br />
Of an enormous city did survive, <br />
And they were enemies: they met beside <br />
The dying embers of an altar-place <br />
Where had been heap'd a mass of holy things <br />
For an unholy usage; they rak'd up, <br />
And shivering scrap'd with their cold skeleton hands <br />
The feeble ashes, and their feeble breath <br />
Blew for a little life, and made a flame <br />
Which was a mockery; then they lifted up <br />
Their eyes as it grew lighter, and beheld <br />
Each other's aspects&mdash;saw, and shriek'd, and died&mdash; <br />
Even of their mutual hideousness they died, <br />
Unknowing who he was upon whose brow <br />
Famine had written Fiend. The world was void, <br />
The populous and the powerful was a lump, <br />
Seasonless, herbless, treeless, manless, lifeless&mdash; <br />
A lump of death&mdash;a chaos of hard clay. <br />
The rivers, lakes and ocean all stood still, <br />
And nothing stirr'd within their silent depths; <br />
Ships sailorless lay rotting on the sea, <br />
And their masts fell down piecemeal: as they dropp'd <br />
They slept on the abyss without a surge&mdash; <br />
The waves were dead; the tides were in their grave, <br />
The moon, their mistress, had expir'd before; <br />
The winds were wither'd in the stagnant air, <br />
And the clouds perish'd; Darkness had no need <br />
Of aid from them&mdash;She was the Universe.<br/> <br/>

In the process of studying these nuclear effects, they also mapped stratospheric wind patterns. Their work was part of a wide range of new research that used the effects of atmospheric nuclear testing to study ecological transport and circulation (see also Kroening 1965; Hare 1962; Odum and Odum 1955)...Satellite surveillance systems increased exponentially in resolution and data collecting power during the Cold War, ultimately measuring weather, temperature, and ozone levels as well as identifying nuclear silos, military bases, and troop movements (see, for example, Mason, Massey, and Bedford 1968). Finally, the integration of these data sets into a comprehensive portrait of global climate was enabled by the long-term military investment in supercomputing (Edwards 1996 and 2000). The history of supercomputing in the United States is deeply intertwined with the history of U.S. nuclear weapons programs. Indeed, the complexity of modeling nuclear weapons explosions may only be exceeded by the complexity of modeling global environmental change. In sum, weather prediction, the study of ice caps, atmospheric and space sciences, satellite cartography, and supercomputing all derive their initial funding and substantial support through the twentieth century from the security logics of the nuclear state and its commitment to building the bomb—thereby establishing the early data sets and infrastructures for climate science.

Beyond the potential for and variability of error that could be statistically tracked and accounted for, it was error provoked by the unimaginable and the invisibilized that often escaped the risk analysis assessments carried out prior to nuclear detonations. An example from Shannon Cram&rsquo;s recent ethnographic research at the Hanford Nuclear Plant illustrates this. All projects at Hanford, she explains, are approved by the Department of Energy on the condition that risk and environmental assessments show that &ldquo;the risk of hazard to workers and the surrounding community&rdquo; is &ldquo;one million to one&rdquo; (Escaping 248). What a requirement like this ignores is that such calculations only measure those risks (to those people or beings) that are within the realm of the &lsquo;known,&rsquo; leaving out all instances where matter and energy behave outside existing scientific consensus. In her analysis, Cram argues that the S-102 accident &ldquo;represented a moment when radioactive waste acted in a way that procedure-creators did not anticipate &mdash; the waste&rsquo;s actions can be said to have exceeded the possible. The material in tank S-102 actually escaped through a dilution hose...the waste changed physical form&rdquo; (249). The reason why the accident happened was the very same reason that made it impossible for it to figure in risk calculations: prior to the event itself, and in the words of one of the interviewed workers, it was &ldquo;decided that waste going up the dilution hose was an incredible fact. (Carol Iglesias, Uncertain Injuries).</h2></div>

This is more than a matter of the language of modulation, or markets, or mathematical models that claim to represent risk. The production of risk is also the material production of exclusion, or if you like, of the relative surplus population, again with an emphasis on relative. We would have to turn in more detail to subaltern studies here and especially to the work of Gayatri Spivak and Dipesh Chakrabarty if we were to pursue the conditions of production that make the concept of probability in difference possible (and by extension the science of financial economics). In subaltern studies epistemological violence and material violence undo the distinction of words and things that the positive science of financial economics, and much of accounting, takes for granted.

Multiplying the number of planes in this drawing by 4699 gives you an approximate number of flights.

According to calculations made in 2018, the tonne of molten S remains at $80 thanks to global supply chains, so despite the large amounts of sulfur mining necessary, only 3% of the budget is spent on this.

This world, here imagined, is a world that has opted for a multiontological approach to geoengineering. It remains to see whether it can challenge the very paradigm of recognition that ontological difference is subsumed under today.
